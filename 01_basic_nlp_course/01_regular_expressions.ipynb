    "## Regular Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first class of the Basic NLP Course, where we will focus on understanding and applying Regular Expressions (Regex). Regex is a powerful tool for text processing and pattern matching, which forms the foundation for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.\n",

    "### Applications in Chemical and Process Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions can be applied in various chemical and process engineering tasks, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Extracting and formatting experimental data from unstructured text files or reports.\n",
    "- **Parsing Chemical Formulas**: Identifying and validating chemical formulas or reaction equations from text.\n",
    "- **Log File Analysis**: Analyzing process logs to detect anomalies or patterns in operational data.\n",
    "- **Simulation Input Validation**: Ensuring that input files for simulation software adhere to specific formats.\n",
    "- **Text Mining**: Extracting relevant information from research papers, patents, or technical documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regex provides a systematic way to handle these tasks efficiently, saving time and reducing errors."
