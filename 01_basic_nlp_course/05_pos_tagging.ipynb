    "\n",
    "Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves assigning a part of speech to each word in a text, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: POS tagging helps in understanding the grammatical structure of a sentence and the relationships between words.\n",
    "- **Example**: In the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\" POS tagging assigns:\n",
    "    - \"The\" → Determiner\n",
    "    - \"quick\" → Adjective\n",
    "    - \"brown\" → Adjective\n",
    "    - \"fox\" → Noun\n",
    "    - \"jumps\" → Verb\n",
    "    - \"over\" → Preposition\n",
    "    - \"the\" → Determiner\n",
    "    - \"lazy\" → Adjective\n",
    "    - \"dog\" → Noun"
